Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. They only work with boolean (true,false) values. There are three logical Operators.
    1. !, ||, &&

Why should we use logical Operators:
    1. They can greatly simplify the logic.
    2. It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
NOT(!):
    It reverse the conditions. i.e if something is true, it makes it false.
    System.out.println(!true) => false
Logical or Operator(||):
    it combines two or more conditions and returns as long as there is one condition is true. if all the conditions becomes false it returns us a false.
Logical AND (&&):
